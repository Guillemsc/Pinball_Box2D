# Vertex Box2D v1.2-beta.1 #

A simple utility for win32 to draw collision polygons for Box2D. It produces a crude list of the coordinates ready to be used in your C/C++ code:

// Pivot 0, 0
int elephant[8] = {
	167, 307,
	313, 183,
	455, 368,
	256, 364
};

// Pivot 0.000000, 0.000000
float elephant[8] = {
	0.185556f, 0.469419f,
	0.347778f, 0.279817f,
	0.505556f, 0.562691f,
	0.284444f, 0.556575f
};

## Usage ##

Drop any PNG file in the window to have the image loaded and ready for editing:

- To add new points use left mouse button
- To duplicate points press ALT while selecting one vertex
- Right button is used to pan around
- Center wheel allows you to zoom in / out
- Press BACKSPACE to delete the last vertex entered
- While selecting a point press DEL to remove it
- Press SHIFT and the right mouse button to move pivot point freely
- Press P to rotate the pivot point to the most common positions

To save your work close the application or load another image. A new file will be created in the same folder of the original image with IMAGE_NAME_coords.txt that will contain the coordinates.

The coordinates will also be copied to the clipboard so you can paste them in your code directly.

The program will look for this file when opening a file and load the points so you can continue your previous work.
